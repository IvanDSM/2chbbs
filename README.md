**2channel-like PHP/MySQL anonymous bulletin board software with support for recursive BBCode.**

Besides PHP/MySQL the only requirement is the GD PHP graphics library. If your PHP installation doesn't include it you can install doing:

> apt-get install php5-gd

And restarting your HTTP server, for instance:

> /etc/init.d/apache2 restart
